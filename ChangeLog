                            ------------------

2018-09-17   1.7.5.p2, Andrei Korostelev
    - FIXED SSL handshake respects timeout passed for read/write socket operations
    - CHANGED Removed unused code
    - CHANGED Formatted source code

2015-12-17   1.7.5.p1, Andrei Korostelev
  - ADDED Multi-process XMLRPC server (based on funtik::MultiProcessRpcServer from contrib)
  - ADDED IPv6 support
  - CHANGED (cleanup) Dropped wbxml_mode functionality, MultiThreadRpcServer, HttpServer, HttpClient, Log4j, chunked transfer support, string macros and more
  - CHANGED (cleanup) Dropped support for Windows and cygwin platforms, MSVC and Borland compilers
  - CHANGED got rid of autotools in favour of plain makefiles
  - ADDED 'make test' will build and execute all tests with clear success/failure indication
  - ADDED ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptograpny) support for SSL connections
  - ADDED support for OpenBSD and for Linux
  - FIXED resolved memleaks in TcpIpConnection and SSLConnection classes
  - CHANGED dropped support for HTTP persisent connections. Being quite a useful feature to improve communication performance it is rather complex to implement it correctly (e.g. garbage-collecting timedout server-side connections; client should then correctly handle such a timed-out connections...). This change basically caused downgrade from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/1.0
  - CHANGED A lot of minor changes/fixes


2010-01-06  1.7.5

 - fix potential memory leak in case of transmission errors
 - fix double-delete in case of transmission errors
 - fix #includes for g++ 4.3  (1.7.4 redo from release)
 - added missing doc file (1.7.4 redo from release)
 - move static variables out of their functions to avoid
   strange effects on some platforms
 - fix issues for g++ 4.4

2007-11-28  1.7.3

 - set SO_LINGER in TcpIpConnection::open() and TcpIpConnection::accept()
   to avoid lost data upon too fast close()
 - provide clone() for classes below ulxr::Protocol

2007-09-29  1.7.2

 - #undef feof legacy macro
 - fixed randomly activated wait values for select()
 - extend docs regarding javascript
 - added virtual methods which are called upon entering and leaving
   MultiThreadRpcServer::serverLoop() and HttpServer::runPicoHttpd()
   to perform some bookkeeping stuff.
 - fixed uninitialized memory when getting the host name

2007-08-31  1.7.1

 - extend docs regarding TCP/IP connection features.
 - added lost line to tests/mt_server.cpp
 - fix a compilation problem on BSD platforms

2007-08-19  1.7.0

 - make stubber process static methods and free functions.
 - common header file for method names.
 - fixes for regression tests.
 - fix namespace issue.
 - pretty-print of xml responses is optional and disabled by default
   to reduce payload and prevent choking of simple xml parsers.
   Re-enable with enableXmlPrettyPrint(true).
 - application "introspect" optionally uses a http proxy and dumps
   the method data into C++ source fragments.
 - issue error when macro "verify" is #define'd.
 - added examples for code generation to docs.
 - timeout for read after accept() was not disabled by passing a 0 but
   was set to a time of 0ms which led to false error messages.
 - added option to set an extra (read: longer) timeout for a persistent connection
   which avoids false error messages when Keep-Alive is used.
 - fixed a problem with lost data when using epoll and ssl together.

2007-07-15  1.6.0

 - re-started stubber from production sources into rpc method source files.
   Migrated sources from mockpp project.
 - added rudimentary logger to log4j/log4cxx logging hosts

1.5.5: 2007-03-01

  - changes to make msvc8 compile with dlls.
    ULXR_USING_DLL and ULXR_MAKING_DLL were replaced with ULXR_STATIC_LIB
    (note: this merely reverses the logic to switch DLL <-> LIB).
    This may break older project files (msvc6/7) and depending projects.
  - fix configure problems with g++-4.1.2.

1.5.4: 2006-10-23

  - buffer for conversions of ulxr::Double may be too small for numbers larger than
    40 bytes and make the app crash after corrupting the stack
  - enable changing format for Double from 1234.5678 to 1.2345678E+3
  - prefix non-reentrant system library calls with a mutex to make them threadsafe
  - add pkg-config file
  - restructured sympol exports for better compiler support
  - compilation fix for cygwin (snprintf not in std)

1.5.3: 2006-07-29

  - fix and enable getpeername() stuff
  - enable gethostbyaddr() only upon request by macro
  - use format from example at www.xmlrpc.com/spec to set date from std::time_t

1.5.2: 2006-05-06

  - use W3C recommendation to represent date and time

1.5.1: 2006-04-27

  - several fixes related to epoll()functionality
  - several internal variables have been renamed to avoid compiler
    warnings due to shadowed members

1.5.0:

 * final: 2006-04-11

  - provide forwarding exception value from a multithreaded request
  - project files for bcb6
  - fix volatile data
  - fixes for x86_64 and probably other 64bit platforms
  - fix for missing iconv
  - fix pdf file
  - set socket timeout
  - added hook in http server loop
  - passing 0 as server port lets system choose a free port
  - signature contains "void" when no method parameters are available
  - MultiProcessRpcServer::shutdownAllThreads and
    HttpServer::shutdownAllThreads not only set a termination flag
    but also shutdown the socket and therefor completely stop the thread.
    This features seems not to work reliably on windows paltforms.
  - cleanup around shutdown() method
  - TcpIpConnection::setTcpNoDelay() disables buffer mechanism and may
    increase overall transmission speed
  - add TryLocker to try to lock a mutex
  - experimental: provide use of epoll() to work around resource limitations
  - fix problem when requesting multithreaded termination in ulxr_http_server.cpp

    seperate method to enable external catching of exceptions

  - return the server handle
  - be tolerant against EINTR/EAGAIN signals and retry
  - disable all unicode and wchar_t related stuff unless explicitly
    enabled with "configure --enable-unicode"
  - potential compatibility break: all 8bit strings are considered UTF-8.
    ==> Use asiiToUtf() or encodingToUtf8() to convert 8bit strings.
  - compatibility break: HttpConnection takes different parameter sets
    ==> either omit hostname or pass hostname+port
  - potential compatibility break: in client mode getPeerName() returns the host name
    which was passed  at object construction and does no more try to get the name after
    the connection is established
  - fix for kerberos compilation problem on red hat
  - optionally compile without multithreading support
  - some other minor patches and fixes
